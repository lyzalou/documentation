Give Admin Access to ElasticBox
***********************************

When you sign up for the ElasticBox Enterprise Edition, you get a default administrator account that lets you globally manage settings for all ElasticBox users in your organization. Besides the default account, you can give any ElasticBox user administrator access through the admin console under Organization > Administrators.

**To give admin access**

1. Log in to ElasticBox as the default administrator.
2. Access to the menu located in the top left, open it and click on **Organizations**.
